       "'(Bloomberg) -- The relentless rally in equities faces a fresh threat over the next few weeks with the world’s biggest money managers set to unload as much as $150 billion of stocks.

The periodic rejigging could knock off as much as 5% from the price of global stocks, according to estimates by JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. Pension funds and other institutional investors check their market exposures to make sure they meet strict allocation limits between equities and bonds every quarter- and month-end. Equities have outperformed bonds so far this quarter, leaving portfolio managers needing to cut their stocks exposure to meet their long-term targets. “The last time we had such gap with equities and bonds in opposite directions was in the fourth quarter of 2021,” Panigirtzoglou said. “This rebalancing flow could create around a 3% to 5% correction in equities.” The pension and sovereign wealth funds that form the backbone of the investing community typically rebalance their market exposures every quarter to achieve a mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds or a similar exposure. So far this quarter MSCI’s all-country stock index is up 5% while the Bloomberg global-aggregate bond index is down 1.3%. Japan’s $1.5 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund or GPIF, the world’s largest pension fund, would have to sell $37 billion of equities to get back to its target asset allocation, according to JPMorgan’s calculations. The $1.3 trillion Norwegian oil fund could move $18 billion from stocks to bonds, while the Swiss National Bank could sell $11 billion worth of stocks. Spokespeople for SNB declined to comment while Norges Bank Investment Management — which manages the Norwegian oil fund — didn’t respond. A spokesperson for GPIF didn’t immediately respond to an email outside of business hours seeking comment. US defined benefit pension plans — which manage $8.5'"

(NYSE: GME) (\"GameStop\" or the \"Company\") today released financial results for the first quarter ended April 29, 2023. The Company’s condensed and consolidated financial statements, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, are below. The Company’s Form 10-Q and supplemental information can be found at https://investor.gamestop.com. FIRST QUARTER OVERVIEW Net sales were $1.237 billion for the period, compared to $1.378 billion in the prior year\\'s first quarter. Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses were $345.7 million, or 27.9% of net sales for the period, compared to $452.2 million, or 32.8% of net sales, in the prior year\\'s first quarter. Net loss was $50.5 million for the period, compared to a net loss of $157.9 million for the prior year’s first quarter. Transition costs related to European restructuring efforts were $14.5 million for the period. For the second quarter, the Company will continue to incur transition charges. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.310 billion at the close of the quarter. Long-term debt remains limited to one low-interest, unsecured term loan associated with the French government’s response to COVID-19. The Company will not be holding a conference call today. Stockholders can review the Company’s Form 10-Q.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in evaluating the Company’s core operating performance. Adjusted SG&A expense, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA exclude the effect of items such as certain transformation costs, asset impairments, severance, as well as divestiture costs. Free cash flow excludes capital expenditures otherwise included in net cash flows from (used in) operating activities.

       "  'What does Gen Z want from business school? A new GMAC report has some answers Gen Z — those born between 1996 and 2012 — is the next major cohort of graduate business students. Already they comprise a huge percentage of graduate management education candidates. They are, in a word, the future — so it’s no wonder that the Graduate Management Admission Council and many other groups are devoting significant effort to finding an answer to the question: What do they want? GMAC’s latest report, released today (June 7), titled Gen Z in the GME Pipeline: Explain Why It’s Worth It, tries to nail down that answer from prospective B-school students in the United States, China, India, and other countries. In it, using both qualitative participant responses and quantitative survey data, GMAC reveals candidates’ attitudes and interests as well as the motivations that spur them and the obstacles that confront them in pursuing graduate business education. (See some of Poets&Quants‘ coverage of past GMAC research on Gen Z here and here.) Of course the Gen Z respondents to GMAC’s new poll vary widely, but in sum: They want strong ROI if they are going to pursue an MBA — but that can mean more than just a high salary. Gen Z makes up nearly one-third of the global population and will make up more than one-quarter of the workforce in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries by 2025. And according to GMAC, Gen Z now comprises more than half of the candidates applying to graduate business education programs. In its latest survey, GMAC communicated primarily through a moderated online community with written, video, and visual participant submissions with 18- to 24-year-old prospective graduate business students in the U.S., China, India, Germany, Peru, and Nigeria. The information they provided was supplemented by quantitative survey research and desk research. The chief findings: “In the classroom, Gen Z want flexibility, real-world application that translates to tangible skills, and opportunities for personal growth through networking and exposure to different perspectives.” Moreover,\\xa0“Gen Z are laser-focused on seeing a return on their investment if they',\n",

On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta. Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance. Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns. Fund Sponsor & Index Managed by Invesco, EWMC has amassed assets over $201.85 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend. Before fees and expenses, EWMC seeks to match the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 Equal Weight Index. The S&P MidCap 400 Equal Weight Index equally weights mid-cap securities in the S&P MidCap 400 Index. Cost & Other Expenses Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same. Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.40% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space. The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.22%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings Most ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock\",\n",

Yet, the magic you found there hasn't fixed GameStop. Some would say the business has gotten worse! First quarter 2023 sales: down 10.3% year over year. First quarter 2023 net loss: $50.5 million versus a net loss of $157.9 million a year ago. In 2022 and 2021 combined, GameStop lost $694.4 million according to your latest annual report. You failed at picking a management team and developing them based on the turnover under your kingdomship. For all his miscues, how couldn't a former Amazon exec in Matt Furlong find some form of success at GameStop? One good quarter maybe? The CFO you picked was canned in July 2022 after about a year on the job. While I am at it, why isn’t there any list of C-suite executives on the GameStop investor page? Showing these bios are standard practice for public companies. All of that's on you as a leader, Ryan. The company remains structurally challenged because of increasing digital game downloads. You still have more than 4,000 retail stores open globally despite more people buying goods and services online. Your push into NFTs failed. Your move to open more fulfillment centers has arguably failed due to top line pressures that aren't going away. Sales of collectibles — a key focus area by management — plunged 22% in the first quarter. There is still no reason for the non-gamer to enter a GameStop store. That's a problem, in my view. Of course, I have not created a huge business like you did at Chewy. Nor have I sold a large business to another company like you did when selling Chewy to Petsmart in 2017.

Last year, Tesla filed a lawsuit to challenge Louisiana\\'s refusal to allow the company to sell vehicles directly to consumers, calling the U.S. state\\'s move protectionist and anticompetitive. The case is part of Tesla\\'s strategy of reversing direct sales bans in some states against the electric carmaker, which bypassed traditional car dealerships to sell vehicles to consumers online or at its own stores. “(T)he direct sales ban applies equally to all manufacturers, and Tesla has alleged no facts regarding anti-Tesla animus on the part of the Louisiana Legislature,\" the ruling said.

       "  '\"Shark Tank\" star and O’Shares Investments Chairman Kevin O’Leary believes Tesla\\'s (TSLA) Cybertruck is setting the electric-vehicle maker up for another big shift in its fortunes. \"It\\'s going to be a boom, because that crazy-looking vehicle has already shown its popularity on preorders two years,\" O’Leary told Yahoo Finance Live. \"It\\'s a very interesting vehicle. It\\'s got a really ugly look. Ugly is interesting. And, you know, to be honest with you, I\\'ve got investments in providers that are providing technology for that truck. And we know the demand is huge,\" he added. The design may be giving off tech-forward brutalist vibes, but that could be positive overall for its production efficiency. Tasha Keeney, director of investment analysis & institutional strategies at ARK Invest, said the vehicle is \"the most misunderstood vehicle release that Tesla has had.\" \"This is really a genius design. It\\'s much more cost effective. It\\'s unlike any other car that we\\'ve seen out there— and from an aesthetic basis,\" Keeney told Yahoo Finance Live. \"But really, because they\\'re, you know, using just one piece of material, they\\'re not using paint, it\\'s going to be a lot more cost effective and easier to produce for them, because we know that the paint shop is, you know, somewhat of a choke point for throughput in an automotive factory,\" Keeney added. Tesla CEO Elon Musk expects the long-awaited Cybertruck will hit mass production in 2023. He has touted that orders crossed 250,000 in the first week of availability — but media reports estimate the total number of reservations are north of 1.5 million for the model. The number of orders received may translate into added margin for the auto manufacturer, in the eyes of O’Leary. \"The one thing I really like about the story that I learned yesterday on the whole Elon thing, the margins on this truck could be really high,\" O’Leary said. \"I mean, this is going to be— because they\\'ve had so much efficiency in manufacturing costs since they announced the truck.

It is only the second time in Tesla’s history that the shares have managed this feat. Tesla has been a “wild stock” over the years, but it has only posted two other double-digit winning streaks in its history, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The first was 10 trading days ending in April 2020, while the second —and the longest one - was less than a year later, in January 2021. Tesla shares closed up 4.1% at $244.40 Friday, bringing this year’s surge to 98%. This week’s 14% advance was the best since January. Friday’s sharp rally came after General Motors Co. on Thursday said it will adapt its EVs to Tesla’s Superchargers, following a similar move from Ford Motor Co., and all but ensuring it will become an industry standard in the US. “More people buying EVs (whether they be GM or Ford for that matter) increases the likelihood that they buy Teslas,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan wrote in a note on Thursday. “A rising tide lifts all boats and if consumers see their neighbor having an EV, they are more likely to buy one themselves - and this increases the chances they buy a Tesla.” Still, this is only the latest in a string of EV and related news that have contributed to Tesla’s',\n",

Delta Air Lines stock (DAL) closed in on its 13th straight day of gains on Tuesday, rising above 2% in midday trading. The stock has climbed more than 23% in the past month, according to Yahoo Finance data. United Airlines (UAL) is the second top performer in the last month, up 17%. JetBlue (JBLU) and American Airlines (AAL) are up roughly 15% in the past month. Southwest (LUV) is tailing behind in the airline rally with a still respectable one-month gain of 12%. There are likely two factors behind the airline stock propulsion. First, is the raw demand to travel at the moment — which appears to have been strong for Memorial Day weekend and now into July 4. \"I was just looking at some July 4 data,\" Marriott International (MAR) CEO Anthony Capuano told Yahoo Finance Live (video above) in an interview last week. \"Revenue per available room is up about 10%. Forward bookings through the end of the year look particularly strong.\" The bullish outlook was echoed by Marriott\\'s long-time rival, Hilton (HLT). \"Demand is strong across the board, I don\\'t care where you are in the world,\" Hilton CFO Kevin Jacobs said on Yahoo Finance Live. \"We don\\'t have months and months of visibility in our business, but from what we can see it\\'s going to be another strong summer.\" Flight searches are up 25% overall for June through August compared to the same time last year, per data from travel booking portal Expedia (EXPE).

Vanda Research said retail purchases of EV stocks other than Tesla made up just 6% of average daily Tesla purchases. Vanda says there are signs Tesla is catching a ride on the wave of AI hype rolling through the stock market. Retail investors are dumping money into Tesla shares, with the stock increasingly seen as a bet on artificial intelligence in addition to the leader in the electric vehicle space. According to Vanda Research, retail traders have ramped up their bullish bets on the EV maker this year, with the 10-day moving average of retail flows into Tesla far outpacing retail flows into other EV stocks, as well as flows into AI stocks, per Vanda data. Retail purchases of EV stocks other than Tesla make up just 6% of average daily Tesla purchases, and make up just 5%-10% of average daily Tesla purchases compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, when Tesla inflows peaked. But it\\'s not just a bet that Tesla will be the top dog in the EV fight that\\'s driving more investment, Vanda says. The blistering rally in Tesla shares in 2023 is partly attributable to the excitement for artificial intelligence technology, which has taken large-cap tech stocks higher through 2023. \"This hardly looks like a resurgence of the EV theme from a retail perspective,\" the research group said in a note on Thursday. \"Hence, we can confidently say that retail investors perceive TSLA as an AI proxy more than an EV story, at least for now.\" Institutional investors have also ramped up their Tesla bets, the note added, a sign that the appetite for Tesla stock has room to grow.

       "  'Tesla stock (TSLA) is surging today, up as much as 4% in early trading and hitting highs not seen since early October of last year, as investor bullishness grows following news that all Model 3 sedans now qualify for the full federal electric vehicle tax credits. Tesla stock is on track for its ninth straight day of gains, its longest winning streak since January 2021. Earlier this week Tesla announced on its website that all versions of the Model 3 sedan now qualify for the full federal EV tax credit of $7,500; previously the cheaper Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) version qualified for half the amount. The federal government confirmed the announcement on its fueleconomy.gov website. The federal government’s requirements for the EV tax credit mandate that 40% of the critical minerals be extracted in the US or a country with a free trade agreement and 50% of the value of the battery components must be manufactured or assembled in North America. Though no reason was given for the change, it can be presumed Tesla updated where it was sourcing the materials for the Model 3 RWD batteries or where it assembles the packs. Prior to the announcement, Tesla was reportedly using LFP (lithium-ion phosphate) battery cells made by China’s CATL. Nevertheless, the inclusion of the full federal tax credit means the Tesla Model 3 RWD now costs $32,740 if buyers meet criteria including income restrictions and MSRP caps ($55,000 for cars; $80,000 for trucks and SUVs). While $32,740 is a relative deal in a new car market where the average price is around $45,000, more incentives can be had on EVs like the Model 3 that pull prices even lower. New York state offers up to $2,000 off EVs via its Drive Clean Rebate for which the Model 3 qualifies. In California, the state offers an even bigger incentive — a $7,500 tax rebate that depends on income and other requirements. Inclusion of both the federal and California state incentives drops the Model 3 down to $25,240 - which Reuters notes is below the cost of a new Toyota'],\n",

       "  'Bitcoin’s mining difficulty level rose 2.18% on Wednesday to an all-time high. The level changes every two weeks and measures the additional computing power a miner has to use to verify transactions on a block. A higher difficulty indicates it is more competitive to mine Bitcoin, reducing profit. The network’s hashrate also increased to a record high. See related article: What’s next for crypto miners after US debt ceiling deal? The mining difficulty reading came in at 52.35 trillion at block height 794,304 in Wednesday’s adjustment. That follows a 3.4% rise in the previous adjustment on June 1, according to data from BTC.com. The difficulty of mining Bitcoin typically rises when more miners are active, which increases the competition for rewards in Bitcoin in return for validating transactions on the network. The higher the difficulty, the less chance a miner has to secure an entire block on the chain, which in turn can reduce a miner’s profitability. Mining difficulty adjustments are correlated to changes in hashrate, the level of computing power used for mining. “In short, difficulty follows hashrate up or down, and hashrate is driven by the overall profitability of building and operating bitcoin data centers,” Andrew Webber, chief of Digital Power Optimization that works with power producers to deploy Bitcoin mining operations, told Forkast in an emailed response earlier this month. “If Bitcoin spot price goes higher, it means larger profits for miners.” Bitcoin’s hashrate was at around 392.6 exahashes per second on Wednesday, an increase from the 375.4 exahashes recorded during the previous adjustment on June 1, data from Blockchain.com shows. Bitcoin fell 3.63% to US$25,045 in the last 24 hours to 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, but it was up about 51% so far this year, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Saylor\\'s MicroStrategy began buying bitcoin in 2020 while calling the cryptocurrency a million times better store of value than gold. The company now holds approximately 140,000 bitcoin worth about $4 billion. In March 2023, Saylor lost a bid to dismiss claims that he failed to pay personal income taxes, interest and penalties due for Washington, D.C. However, the court dismissed claims that Saylor and MicroStrategy had conspired to violate the law. Saylor said that since 25,000 other cryptocurrencies (approximately) have been angling to position themselves as bitcoin or a better bitcoin, the public now understands that bitcoin is the next bitcoin. He said the \"next logical step\" is for bitcoin to multiply 10 times in value to $250,000. \"Eventually, I have confidence that the crypto exchanges will come around to realising that bitcoin really is the dominant asset in this space, and their business models are fine when bitcoin goes up by a factor of 10,\" Saylor said.

Other major cryptocurrencies dipped, with ether (ETH-USD) and BNB (BNB-USD) falling more than 5% and a stablecoin called tether going below its crucial $1 price. Those drops dragged the total market value for all crypto assets to its lowest level since the banking turmoil began in March, according to Coinmarketcap. Publicly traded crypto companies also fell, including the stock of Coinbase Global (COIN). Other crypto stocks including MicroStrategy (MSTR), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Marathon Digital (MARA) sold off as well. The new price pressures follow assurances from the Federal Reserve that it isn’t done hiking interest rates this year along with reports that crypto lending platforms Delio and Haru paused withdrawals after facing heightened requests from customers. Regulators also are turning up the heat on the industry with two new lawsuits filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission last week against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance, alleging that 19 specific cryptocurrencies are securities and thus should be registered with the SEC. Those tokens — which include BNB, SOL, ADA, and MATIC — have fallen 10-14% since the lawsuits. \"Until the regulatory environment is better, cryptos might struggle here,\" Oanda market analyst Edward Moya said Thursday.

BTC was recently trading at about $25,171, off 3.1% over the past four hours, part of a wider crypto selloff. The largest cryptocurrency in market value had been traveling comfortably just below $26,000 for much of the past five days as markets awaited the latest interest rate decision by the U.S. central bank and continued to chew over last week's U.S. Securities and Exchange lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase. The Federal Reserve elected to suspend rate hikes, but comments by bank Chair Jerome Powell following the announcement appeared to spook markets. Powell reiterated the Fed's commitment to sink annual inflation to a target 2.5%. It currently stands at 4%. But critics of bank policy say that the focus on prices risks sending the economy into a recession. Just as equity markets were closing a lackluster day, digital assets plunged. Ether, the second largest crypto by market\",\n",
       "  'A day after bitcoin dipped to a three-month low, crypto investors remained jittery, keeping bitcoin and most major altcoins in the doldrums and knocking Tether’s USDT stablecoin from its $1 peg. Bitcoin was recently trading at $25,239, roughly flat over the past 24 hours after spending most of Thursday in negative territory. On Wednesday BTC tumbled below this threshold for the first time since mid-March, according to CoinDesk Indices, as markets recoiled from a recommitment to monetary hawkishness from the Federal Reserve even as the central bank paused interest rate hikes for the first time in 14 months. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap had been traveling closer to $26,000 for weeks. Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was similarly sluggish to recently change hands at about $1,655, also about flat from Wednesday, same time. Similar to BTC, ETH hit a three-month low on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Tether’s USDT stablecoin deviated from its $1 dollar peg early Thursday (ET) amid a sell-off on the popular Uniswap and Curve pools. USDT dropped as low as $0.9968, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token was recently trading at $0.999. Read More: USDT Selling on Curve, Uniswap Spooks Traders Amid Bitcoin Drop “This has been a very nervous time, with a lot of regulatory concerns now being compounded into concerns about Tether,” Riyad Carey, a research analyst at digital assets data provider Kaiko, wrote to CoinDesk in a Twitter message. “Its depeg this morning has severely rattled markets, given that its dominance has increased significantly in the past few months.” Carey added: “It was yet another consequence of falling liquidity; a big reason for its depeg was the massive outflow of liquidity from the (Curve) 3pool.” Among other cryptos with the largest market caps, MATIC, the token of the smart contracts platform Polygon, recently plunged more than 5%. The U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) mentioned MATIC among 19 cryptos in its lawsuits against crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase last week. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently down nearly 3%. Cryptos’ fade over the past two days']}"
